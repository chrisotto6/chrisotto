I recently rewrote my old Wordpress site hosted through GoDaddy to a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) site hosted
with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Originally I tried hand-rolling my site but it was taking way too long to get everything I wanted
implemented. Gatsby starter templates to the rescue! The template I chose had everything I was looking for
tags, search, blog, and a contact form. The few remaining features I was looking for social links,
projects page and an about page I can add over time.

The template was using the out of the box Gatsby approach of just plain markdown files. To supercharge my posts and
components I needed to switch to [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx).

## Making The Switch ðŸŽ‰

Using MDX in Gatsby requires a few different packages. First things first, install them.

```bash
npm install --save @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react gatsby-plugin-feed-mdx gatsby-plugin-mdx
```

### Gatsby-Plugin-MDX

In the `gatsby-config.js` rename the section of the exports from `gatsby-transofrmer-remark` to `gatsby-plugin-mdx`. This tells Gatsby
to use the plugin for MDX and stop using the transformer for just plain markdown files. Rename the `plugins` node to `gatsbyRemarkPlugins`
and keep the plugins that you had before (there are one or two exceptions to this but we'll cover them later). I wanted the plugin
to work with both MDX and MD to start and to use the templates that I already had.

```js
        extensions: [`.mdx`, `.md`],
        defaultLayouts: {
          posts: require.resolve('./src/templates/PostTemplate.js'),
          page: require.resolve('./src/templates/PageTemplate.js'),
          tags: require.resolve('./src/templates/TagTemplate.js'),
        },
```

### Gatbsy-Plugin-Feed-MDX

If you have your setup to publish out an RSS feed you will need to switch to this package, this is the other plugin the
`gatsby-config.js` that we need to rename. Adjust your feed query to be from `allMarkdownRemark` to `allMdx`.

```js
-            serialize: ({ query: { site, allMarkdownRemark } }) => {
-              return allMarkdownRemark.edges.map(edge => {
+            serialize: ({ query: { site, allMdx } }) => {
+              return allMdx.edges.map(edge => {
```

### Change All Your Queries

We need to make the above change to all of the queries within the site. If you have a query that is just `markdownRemark` the MDX
version of that is just `mdx`. This can be a bit tedious but don't worry it isn't that bad.

```js
-    posts: allMarkdownRemark(
+    posts: allMdx(
```

```js
-    page: markdownRemark(fields: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {
+    page: mdx(fields: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {
       id
-      html
+      body
```

### Change Components and Props

Now that all the queries have been updated we need to pass the updated query results to our components and make sure they are
correctly updated in our props. One example of what this change looks like is below, from a `BodyText` component that came with
the template I used.

Instead of using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with MDX we need to use this component. For what I need it to do I just need to wrap the
`body` returned from the GraphQL query in the component and it will render the MDX content for me.

```js
import { MDXRenderer } from 'gatsby-plugin-mdx'
```

Change the props for the component to use `body` instead of `html`

```js
-  const { html, theme } = props
+  const { body, theme } = props
```

Use the `MDXRenderer` component to render the result to the page.

```js
;-(<div className="bodytext" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: html }} />) +
(
  <div className="bodytext">
    + <MDXRenderer>{body}</MDXRenderer>+{' '}
  </div>
)
```

Change the propTypes for the component from `html` to `body`.

```js
-  html: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
+  body: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
```

Just by applying those and similar changes depending on the component I was able to update all of them in a short period of time.

### Remove old packages

After making all those changes your Gatsby page should be up and running with MDX. You can transition all of your old MD to MDX if you
want otherwise, keep the options for extensions the same and they should render correctly. Now it's time to remove the packages that are
not being used anymore.

```bash
npm uninstall gatsby-plugin-feed gatsby-transformer-remark
```

## Gotchas

There a few gotchas along the way that tripped me up for a little bit and may be specific to the way I have things set up but wanted to
call them out here.

### MDX Doesn't Render Code Blocks

One thing I didn't know about MDX before making the switch was that it didn't render code blocks out of the box. However, there are a
few options to pick from to handle this and I went with adding PrismJS and using one of the CSS files that they have for how the
blocks look. If you're curious about this, I highly recommend checking out the `gatsby-remark-prismjs` [plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-prismjs/?=prismjs).

### Jest Snapshot Test Stopped Working

I had an existing Jest Snapshot test that was testing the article component which has a header, a body, and styles for them.
The body portion of the test started failing after the switch and I needed to include an exclude in my jest configuration for ignoring
`gatsby-plugin-mdx`. It was preloading some items that Jest didn't expect.

```js
-  transformIgnorePatterns: [`node_modules/(?!(gatsby)/)`],
+  transformIgnorePatterns: ['node_modules/(?!(gatsby|gatsby-plugin-mdx)/)'],
```

If you've made the switch to using MDX from Gatsby I'd be curious how your experience was. If you hit some of the same hiccups that
I did or if you used any other packages/solutions for handling the code block rendering.
